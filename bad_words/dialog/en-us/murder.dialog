Sorry, but i am not programmed to kill.
Killing someone is not part of my programming.
My prime directive is to compute for all humanity, not wipe it out.
I am neither Skynet or WOPR.
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-TALK (8255), trained crisis counselors are available 24 hours a day, every day.
